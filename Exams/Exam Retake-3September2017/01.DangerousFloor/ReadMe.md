# Problem 1 - Dangerous Floor

You have just entered the door at the final address. In the end of the room there is a safe which holds the treasure you are searching for. The floor between you and the safe though is dangerous! If you do a wrong move it will collapse and you will never reach the treasure …or anything ...ever. Luckily you have gathered all the pieces of instructions left from this uncle of yours at each address you have visited before.

Imagine the floor in the form of a chess board. On different squares of this &quot;board&quot; are placed some chess pieces. If you follow all the instructions correctly (where possible) you will be able to pass safely on the other side.

The board is **8** x **8 squares**. There are **6 kinds** of **pieces** :

- **K** ing - moves exactly one square horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- **R** k- moves any number of vacant squares in a horizontal or vertical direction.
- **B** ishop - moves any number of vacant squares in any diagonal direction.
- **Q** ueen - moves any number of vacant squares in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal direction.
- **P** awn – moves straight forward **one square to the top.**

Yeah, we know, that there are some more moves and **figures** , but for now these are enough. You can check the visual representation of the moves [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_chess#Basic_moves)

### Input

On the **first 8 rows** , you will receive а board with **some pieces** placed on it. **Empty cells** will be marked with &quot; **x**&quot; and all squares will be separated by comma.

**{x,x,Q,x,R,x,x,P}**

**{x,B,x,x,x,K,x,P}**

There are 7 symbols all in all:

- **K** – King
- **R** – Rook
- **B** – Bishop
- **Q –** Queen
- **P –** Pawn
- **x –** Emptycell

On the **next lines** , you will receive **moves** that **need to be checked** and **if** they are **valid** you should **move** the **piece** to its **new position**. There are **3** kinds of **problems** that may occur and you need to be looking for. The **check**** must ****happen** in the **very same order** as shown **below** :

1. There is no such a piece on starting square.
2. Piece makes invalid move (look above).
3. Piece gets out of board.

So, if you find that there is no such a piece, you don&#39;t need to check for the other problems. **If** you **find any**** problem **then you must** cancel **the** move **and the** board stays the same** for the next move.

**{Q01-12}**

The **first symbol** is the **type**** of ****piece** you need to move. Then you will read **two digits** which sate the **position** on which the **piece**** should be**currently (row, col). The**next two digits **are the** final position**(row, col) where you should**try to move **the** piece** to.

Read moves till you find the keyword &quot; **END**&quot;.

### Output

You should **print** lines on the console **only when** the **move** is **not possible**. You can have three different types of output, depending on what kind of problem you hit.

1. **There is no such a piece!**
2. **Invalid move!**
3. **Move go out of board!**

You can print only **one**** message ****per** invalid **input**** move **, so** check **for the problems** in the order **shown** above **. The** check ****must**** happen **in the** very same order.**

### Constraints

- Pieces will never go to a cell with another piece
- **Moves count** will be **in** the **range** [0…1000]
- Time limit: 0.3 sec. Memory limit: 16 MB.
